In this lesson you will learn about reading BPF-maps from another "external"
program.

In basic03 the [[file:../basic03-map-counter/xdp_load_and_stats.c][xdp_load_and_stats.c]] program were both doing BPF/XDP-loading
and reading stats from the map. This was practical as the map
file-descriptor was readily available. In this lesson this program have been
split into two separate program, one focused on BPF/XDP-loading
([[file:xdp_loader.c]]) and one focused on reading and printing stats
([[file:xdp_stats.c]]).
