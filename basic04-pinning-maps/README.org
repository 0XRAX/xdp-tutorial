In this lesson you will learn about reading BPF-maps from another "external"
program.

In basic03 the [[file:../basic03-map-counter/xdp_load_and_stats.c][xdp_load_and_stats.c]] program were both doing BPF/XDP-loading
and reading stats from the map. This was practical as the map
file-descriptor was readily available. In this lesson this program have been
split into two separate programs:
 - one focused on BPF/XDP-loading ([[file:xdp_loader.c]]) and
 - one focused on reading and printing stats ([[file:xdp_stats.c]]).

The basic quest revolves around how to share or obtain the UNIX
file-descriptor to the BPF-map, that we want to read from. Access to a
BPF_map still goes through the BPF-syscall, but the handle is a standard
UNIX file-descriptor.
