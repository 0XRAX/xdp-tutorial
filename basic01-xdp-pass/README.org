Welcome to the first step in this XDP-tutorial.

The programming language for XDP is eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) which
we will just refer to as BPF. Thus, this tutorial will also be relevant for
learning how to write other BPF program.  The focus is on eBPF programs
that can be used in the XDP-hook.
