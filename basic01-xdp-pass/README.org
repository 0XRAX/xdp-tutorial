Welcome to the first step in this XDP-tutorial.

The programming language for XDP is eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) which
we will just refer to as BPF. Thus, this tutorial will also be relevant for
learning how to write other BPF program.  The focus is on eBPF programs
that can be used in the XDP-hook.

* First step: setup dependencies

There are a number of setup dependencies, that need to in-order to compile the
source code in this git-repository. Please go read and complete the
[[file:../setup_dependencies.org]] guide.

Return here, and see if the next step compiles.

* Compiling example code

If you completed the setup dependencies guide, then you should be able to
simply run the =make= command, in this directory. (The [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] will try to
be nice and detect if you didn't complete the setup steps).
