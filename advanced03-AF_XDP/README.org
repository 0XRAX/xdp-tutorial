#+TITLE: Advanced: XDP userspace delivery via AF_XDP
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

It is important to understand that XDP in-itself is not a kernel bypass
facility. XDP is an *in-kernel* fast-path, that operates on raw-frames
"inline" before they reach the normal Linux Kernel network stack.

To support fast delivery of /raw-frames into userspace/, XDP can *bypass*
the Linux Kernel network stack via XDP_REDIRECT'ing into a special BPF-map
containing AF_XDP sockets. The AF_XDP socket is an new Address Family type.
