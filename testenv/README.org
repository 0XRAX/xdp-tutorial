#+TITLE: Test environment script
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

This directory contains a test environment setup script that you can use to
create test environments for testing your XDP programs. It works by creating
virtual ethernet (veth) interface pairs and moving one end of each pair to
another namespace. You can load the XDP program in the other namespace and
send traffic to it through the interface that is visible in the root
namespace.

Examples:

Setup new environment named "test":
=./testenv.sh create test=

Enter the environment:
=./testenv.sh enter test=

Execute a command inside the environment:
=./testenv ns_exec test ip a=

Teardown the environment:
=./testenv teardown test=
